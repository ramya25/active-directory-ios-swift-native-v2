# MSAL iOS Swift Microsoft Graph API Sample 

![Build Badge](https://identitydivision.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/a7934fdd-dcde-4492-a406-7fad6ac00e17/523/badge)

| [Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/guidedsetups/active-directory-ios)| [Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc) | [API Reference](https://azuread.github.io/docs/objc/) | [Support](README.md#community-help-and-support)
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The MSAL preview library for iOS and macOS gives your app the ability to begin using the [Microsoft Cloud](https://cloud.microsoft.com) by supporting [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. This sample demonstrates all the normal lifecycles your application should experience, including:

* How to get a token
* How to refresh a token
* How to call the Microsoft Graph API
* How to sign a user out of your application

## Scenario

This app is a multi-tenant app meaning it can be used by any Azure AD tenant or Microsoft Account.  It demonstrates how a developer can build apps to connect with enterprise users and access their Azure + O365 data via the Microsoft Graph.  During the auth flow, end users will be required to sign in and consent to the permissions of the application, and in some cases may require an admin to consent to the app.  The majority of the logic in this sample shows how to auth an end user and make a basic call to the Microsoft Graph.

## Example

```swift
    if let application = try? MSALPublicClientApplication.init(clientId: <your-client-id-here>) {
        application.acquireToken(forScopes: kScopes) { (result, error) in
            if result != nil {
                    // Set up your app for the user
            } else {
                print(error?.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
    }
    else {
            print("Unable to create application.")
        } 
```

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

* Xcode
* An internet connection

## Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From Terminal:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-ios-swift-native-v2.git
```
or download and extract the repository.zip file, and navigate to 'MSALiOS.xcworkspace' from the active-directory-ios-swift-native-v2 folder

## Step 2: (Optional) 1A: Register your App  
The app comes pre-configured for testing.  If you would like to register your own app, please follow the steps below.

To Register,
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account.

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**

3. You will need to have a native client application registered with Microsoft using the [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) experience.

To create an app,  
1. Click the **New registration** button on the top left of the page.
2. On the app registration page,
    - Name your app
    - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**
    - Select **Register** to finish.
3. After the app is created, you'll land on your app management page. Click **Authentication**, and look at the Redirect URI suggestions. Select the first item, which will be in this format: `msal<clientID>://auth`.
4. Hit the **Save** button in the top left, to save these updates. 

## 1B: Installation

Load the podfile using cocoapods. This will create a new XCode Workspace you will load.

From terminal navigate to the directory where the podfile is located

```
$ pod install
...
$ open MSALiOS.xcworkspace
```
## 1C: Configure your application

1. Add your application's redirect URI scheme to added in the portal to your `info.plist` file. It will be in the format of `msal<client-id>`
```xml
    <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
            <string>Editor</string>
            <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
            <string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
            <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
            <array>
                <string>msal+your-client-id-here</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </array>
```

2. Configure your application defaults

In the `ViewControler.swift` file, update the `kClientID` variable with your client ID.

```swift
    // Update the below to your client ID you received in the portal. The below is for running the demo only
    
    let kClientID = "<your-client-id-here>"
```

## Step 3: Run the sample

Click the Run Button in the top menu or go to Product from the menu tab and select Run.

## Security Library

This library controls how users sign-in and access services. We recommend you always take the 
latest version of our library in your app when possible. We 
use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) so you can control the risk associated with updating 
your app. As an example, always downloading the latest minor version number (e.g. x.*y*.x) ensures 
you get the latest security and feature enhanements but our API surface remains the same. You 
can always see the latest version and release notes under the Releases tab of GitHub.

## Security Reporting

If you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it 
to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your 
submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) 
program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will 
contact you shortly upon receiving the information. We encourage you to get notifications of when 
security incidents occur by 
visiting [this page](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948) and subscribing 
to Security Advisory Alerts.
